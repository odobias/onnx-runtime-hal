# AMD VAIML window-partition first-inference crash

Minimal, source-only reproducer for a native crash in AMD's Vitis AI
Execution Provider (VAIML). The runner generates a tiny synthetic ONNX graph on
the target machine, verifies its SHA-256, confirms ORT CPU can execute it, then
runs the same graph through `VitisAIExecutionProvider`.

On the affected stack, VAIML compiles the generated graph without errors and
creates an inference session, then `onnxruntime_vitisai_ep.dll` access-violates
on the first `Run()`.

## What ships

This directory is intentionally source-only:

- `bootstrap.ps1` - validates the selected Python/runtime, optionally installs
  Python graph-generation packages, and can download AMD SDK/driver installers.
- `run.ps1` - portable Windows runner for a new machine.
- `repro.py` - generates `model.onnx`, runs CPU control, then runs VitisAI.
- `requirements.txt` - Python packages needed to generate the ONNX graph.
- `.gitignore` - ignores the generated `model.onnx` and Python cache files.

`model.onnx` is **not committed**. It is generated locally by `repro.py` from
ONNX helper calls. The generated graph has no trained weights and no captured
customer inputs; it uses synthetic LayerNorm parameters (`ones` / `zeros`) and a
deterministic random input seed (`20260711`).

## Reproduced environment

- AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 / XDNA 2 NPU
- Ryzen AI SDK 1.8.0-beta
- ONNX Runtime `1.25.1.dev20260617`
- Python 3.12.11
- Windows 11 build 26200

Both a cold compile and a load from the populated VAIML cache reproduce the same
process crash.

## Bootstrap on a new machine

The failing provider is AMD-specific. Vanilla `pip install onnxruntime` is **not**
enough and can actively confuse the repro because it does not include
`VitisAIExecutionProvider`. Use the Ryzen AI SDK Python/runtime.

The bootstrap script validates the selected Python, optionally installs the
lightweight graph-generation packages (`numpy`, `onnx`), and checks that
`onnxruntime` exposes `VitisAIExecutionProvider`:

```powershell
.\repros\amd-vaiml-window-partition\bootstrap.ps1 -InstallPythonDeps
```

Override the SDK Python if needed:

```powershell
.\repros\amd-vaiml-window-partition\bootstrap.ps1 `
  -Python C:\path\to\ryzen-ai-env\python.exe `
  -InstallPythonDeps
```

The script tries these Python locations, in order:

1. `-Python <path>` argument
2. `$env:RYZEN_AI_PYTHON`
3. `C:\ProgramData\miniforge3\envs\ryzen-ai-1.8.0-beta\python.exe`
4. `python` on `PATH`

If the AMD SDK is missing, bootstrap can download the official AMD installer and
NPU driver archive and verify their SHA-256 hashes:

```powershell
.\repros\amd-vaiml-window-partition\bootstrap.ps1 `
  -DownloadRyzenAI `
  -AcceptAmdDownloadTerms
```

It deliberately does **not** silently launch vendor installers. Those may require
administrator rights and license prompts, and pretending otherwise would be
bullshit.

## Run

From the repository root:

```powershell
.\repros\amd-vaiml-window-partition\run.ps1
```

Run bootstrap first, then execute the repro:

```powershell
.\repros\amd-vaiml-window-partition\run.ps1 -Bootstrap -InstallPythonDeps
```

Override the SDK Python if needed:

```powershell
.\repros\amd-vaiml-window-partition\run.ps1 `
  -Python C:\path\to\ryzen-ai-env\python.exe
```

Force model regeneration:

```powershell
.\repros\amd-vaiml-window-partition\run.ps1 -RegenerateModel
```

Verify the cached VAIML path after one cold run:

```powershell
.\repros\amd-vaiml-window-partition\run.ps1 -ReuseCache
```

Use an explicit VAIML cache directory:

```powershell
.\repros\amd-vaiml-window-partition\run.ps1 `
  -CacheDir C:\temp\amd-vaiml-window-repro-cache
```

## Expected behavior on the affected stack

1. `repro.py` generates `model.onnx` locally.
2. CPU returns a finite tensor with shape `[64, 64, 96]`.
3. `aiecompiler` prints `Compilation Complete` with `ERROR:0`.
4. ORT prints `Session created; providers=['VitisAIExecutionProvider', ...]`.
5. The first VitisAI inference terminates Python with access violation
   `0xC0000005` (signed exit code `-1073741819`).

## Generated graph

The generated `model.onnx` contains a `LayerNormalization` followed by the
dynamic shape/reshape/transpose sequence that partitions a `[1,4096,96]` tensor
into 64 windows of `[64,96]`.

Expected generated model properties:

```text
bytes: 12884
sha256: d4059b6e2f8beb7a2b36ee2217beb0f52d444be034d004906fc34b1b66ea2eac
```

`repro.py` checks this hash after generation. If intentional graph edits change
it, update `GENERATED_MODEL_SHA256` in `repro.py` and this README together.

ORT graph rewrites are deliberately disabled. With normal optimization the
dynamic shape sequence can be folded or assigned to CPU, which prevents VAIML
from claiming the failing structure and hides the defect rather than fixing it.

## Observed native failure

The top frame is inside `onnxruntime_vitisai_ep.dll`:

```text
Compilation Complete
(WARNING:75, CRITICAL-WARNING:0, ERROR:0)
Session created; providers=['VitisAIExecutionProvider', 'CPUExecutionProvider']
Running first inference...
Exception Code: 0xC0000005
onnxruntime_vitisai_ep.dll + 0x3524D7B
onnxruntime_vitisai_ep.dll + 0x330F67C
onnxruntime_vitisai_ep.dll + 0x33FB8DF
...
onnxruntime_providers_vitisai.dll + 0x236C4
```

The DLL is stripped and the reported nearby `xir_deserialize_cif` symbol has
large offsets, so that symbol name should not be treated as a reliable source
location.

## Relationship to the original FakeAudio failure

This graph was reduced from the first HTSAT window-partition block while
investigating FakeAudio on VAIML. The complete isolated block exposes a second
runtime defect after successful compilation:

```text
FlexMLDispatcher: HSI input slot count 1 is inconsistent with ifms.size()=4
and deviceBatchSize=1
```

That larger graph contains model-derived structure and is not required for this
report. This directory is the clean vendor-facing reproducer: tiny, synthetic,
deterministic, source-only, and free of proprietary tensors.
